NTHIGA DENIS PROJECT is a simple project that accesses the weather of any major city in the world 

its fetches data from an API and if the key is correct returns the current climatic condition of the City.


The applicaion is pure Javascript with no frameworks used.
it is made up of :
1.    a javascript files
2.     a css file for styling the webpage
3.     a HTML file 

The project is functional and is a true representation of my work.

for proper functionality of the project the live server  should be on...i.e. you run the  commnad

```live server --watch db.json ```

The project uses a Private API on openweather.org that you have to create an account with the organisation to use their API keys


The project represents my own thinking and is my own pure woeking 

On the search button you enter a CIty name i.e an International city eg 
Nairobi, tokyo,accra but not small towns as the API is worlwide
